    "## Overview - Creating RAG System with OpenAI API and LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "### This notebook demonstrates how to build a complete RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system using OpenAI's GPT-4o model and embedding model with LangChain framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Features:\n",
    "### - Uses OpenAI GPT-4o as the generation model for answering questions\n",
    "### - Uses OpenAI text-embedding-3-small as the embedding model for document vectorization\n",
    "### - Supports multiple document formats (PDF, TXT, DOCX, etc.)\n",
    "### - Provides interactive Gradio web interface for user interaction\n",
    "### - Implements FAISS vector database for efficient similarity search\n"
